For this project, we were tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency. In order to deploy this project, we used the `crypto_wallet.py` file, `fintech_finder.py` file, ganache, and streamlit.

The code we added for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/AmiraAli23/Unit-19-Homework-Cryptocurrency-Wallet/blob/c4508e89e32df9c3b438ffc85b3d0dafce7c502f/fintech_finder.py)

Once the code was complete, we used the application's web interface to send transactions and observe those transactions on ganache.

When we launch the app on streamlit, we are able to see each fintech professional with their pictures, account address to send the transaction to, finder rating, as well as their hourly rate in Eth.

On the top left, it shows the account address in ganache that is paying out the ether, as well as their account balance after the transaction, 49.998 in this case. 

We are able to select the fintech professional of our choosing, and the amount of hours we choose to hire them for.
For this example, I chose Ash and opted to hire them for 0.05 hours.

Ash's addresss can also be seen on the left, as well as his hourly rate and the wage he would receive in ether.

Once I navitage to ganache, i can observe the same balance left in my account , 49.998.

Transaction details can be found above . The total wage in ether on the streamlit app is 0.0165 which is rounded to two decimal places on ganache - 0.02 ETH.

The "To" address also matches Ash's address.
